# Quantum-Reservoir-Computing-Utilizing-Quantum-Chaotic-Systems-with-Heisenberg-XXZ-Spin-Chains

This is a simulation program using pyhton to evaluate quantum chaos in quantum reservoir computing that I created during my master's research.

"check the integrability of the dataset" evaluates the integrability of the dataset used in the study by calculating the Poisson distribution and the KL divergence with the GOE.

"Accuracy evaluation of classification tasks on time series data by perturbation strength and length of time evolution" is the main simulation program. It measures the accuracy of classification tasks by varying the size λ of the perturbation applied to the Heisenberg XXZ chain and the length τ of time evolution of the quantum system, prints the top 10 patterns and the bottom 10 patterns, and generates heat maps.
